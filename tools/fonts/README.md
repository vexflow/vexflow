## base64.js

This script encodes *.woff2 font files as Base64 strings and saves the fonts to the vexflow/src/fonts/ directory.
OPTIONAL: Run this only if you wish to create a custom build of vexflow-xxxx.js that includes one or more fonts.
The recommended approach is to use vexflow-core.js to load any SMuFL font at runtime.

## Gonville

The Gonville font was designed by Simon Tatham. It has been used by VexFlow [since 2010](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/tree/8c10ac8aee4cd92f71786ae1c6cd751497bcb753/src/fonts).
